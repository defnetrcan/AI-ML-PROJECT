# Introduction
The aim of our project is to determine the performance of three machine learning models, Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree, in predicting the **Happiness Index** using a dataset indicators. With this project we aimed to evaluate and find the best model for this task by analyzing the predictive accuracy of the models using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² (coefficient of determination). The key objective of our project is to conclude a preprocessing, conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and eventually do a model comparison to find the best model that would result in optimum performance for the prediction of happiness, considering accuracy, robustness, and generalization.

# Methods

As of requirements, in this project we selected three models specifically used for regression: Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Trees. These models are used to predict our target variable which is happines_index. Our tasks were directly relevant to regression. This is because, first of all, our target variable "happiness_index" is numerical and continuous. Then, it can be seen that our task involves predicting the happiness_index by using other variables and features in our dataset. Therefore, we decided to test models that are applicable for regression. We chose 3 models as required to train: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees. Linear Regression served as a simple baseline for comparison, Random Forest is chosen to handle also the nonlinear relationships and outliers, and lastly, we chose decision trees to offer us more interpretability and a quicker evaluation.
